**#Management Game Users**
======================
I am making a program to manage the information of game users.


##management_gameuser
----------------------
###Usage
Load the information of the user stored in the file to add, delete, and update the user.
Information from existing files can be replaced with new files.

###Known Bugs
There are some bugs.
You can retrieve the file at the beginning of the program. 
However, an error occurs when a file is called up when the user's information is in memory.
When sorting information of users in memory or files, it is not sorted.
After deleting the user's information, the information in the file disappears, but a bug occurs that remains in memory.
